<h1>CAR RENTAL</h1>
<h2>Subject area</h2>

A customer selects a car from the list of available cars. Then he books an order by filling out the order form and
setting up the rental period. The administrator sees a list of all created orders, which he can confirm, complete or
cancel (with the cancellation reason mark). The administrator registers the return of the car. Together with the
completion of the order, the administrator creates a return form and fills out the information about the car's damages
and additional bill value (in necessary).
